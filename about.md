title: About
---
I like freedom, debate, math and computers. Even though I'm not great at either of those, I am always striving to become smarter and more knowledgable with the help of the internet and mindful folks over at freenode's IRC server. All of that when not trying to make the ends meet through selling my labour to the capitalist.

I like rationality and tranquility, dislike hierarchies and dispise mindless conformity.

You can contact me through /surname/ at gmail or on IRC by the name *ij* or *s*.
