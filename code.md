### [My blog](/source.tar.bz2) haskell, hakyll
The git repo of this blog, excluding articles listed in index.

#### [My gists](https://gist.github.com/siers) Bunch of little utilities, mentionable effort.

### [Violin pitchfork](https://github.com/siers/violin-pitchfork) haskell, fft, sox, 2015 jun
I wrote a tuning pitchfork that listens to the string you're trying to play and
responds with the correct pitch.

### [Heat equation solver](https://github.com/siers/parabolic-pde#pretty-pictures) haskell, repa, 2014 dec
Main reason of creation was the generation of cool [gifs](https://github.com/siers/parabolic-pde#pretty-pictures).

#### [Plot sphere](https://gist.github.com/siers/1923564ca206c1b36f47) Probably the first real [plotting](http://i.imgur.com/8orPDZ3.png) I've done.

### [Sudoku solver](https://github.com/siers/sudoku-solver) haskell, 2014 nov
For educational purposes, but the code is nice, so I'll include it.

### [ELF executable crypter POC](https://github.com/siers/stoical) c, 2012 dec
Making a PE crypter was an old goal of mine, but having become a linux user,
PEs were no longer interesting. The code doesn't use libraries thus is a little messy,
but it works most of time.

### [BF language interpreter](https://github.com/siers/bf) linux, c, asm, 2011 aug
With the intent of learning about asm.
