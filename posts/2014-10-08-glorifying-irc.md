title: Glorifying IRC
---
Getting myself to learn or do something interesting to make self smarter isn't always just that easy. Motivation comes from ever learning more, but unless one's been at it the last couple of days, the will only weakens.

What I can do to get some motivation though,
is to find a problem that tickles one's mind enough
to feel like one's got an answer at the tip of one's tounge, although that might not always be the case, as it later might turn out.

Whenever one's being far from the answer, it always helps to communally chatter[^verb]...
or think together *with* someone!

In those cases, IRC always is right around the corner, specifically irc.freenode.net and its channels.
It has done wonders with my english, programming skills, boredom and helped me with numerous things.
\#haskell has always been very inspirational and motivating,
\##asm has helped me with [this](https://github.com/siers/stoical).

The lines never stop coming, curiosity doesn't cease flowing.
Free access to so many welcoming enthusiasts of all areas,
users who are basically donating their time as educators
and have made me a smarter, technically more capable person.

That's what I like about it; why I think it's worth being glorified...

Power and glory to the virtual communities of free minds!

[^verb]: It is actually a [verb too](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chatter#Verb).
[^yes]: My expectations here are indeed too high.
