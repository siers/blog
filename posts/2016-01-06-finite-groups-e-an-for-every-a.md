title: In finite groups e = a^n for every a

I wanted to prove it, so I did. Being bad with mathematical induction
is also among the reasons. The proof includes tons of gory details, which to me were the most interesting part of
this endeavour.
Fortunately, the proof of |C| + 1 <= |G| has been left out.
