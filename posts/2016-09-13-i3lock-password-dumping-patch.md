title: Dumping incorrect password entries from i3lock
---
For some reason I couldn't type the right password into `i3lock`. I always could in terminals though.
To check what `i3lock` thinks I'm writing, I wrote a patch to dump the passwords.
I also registered it in the package manager with AUR and made the `PKGBUILD` include the patch in the build,
though that's optional and it was for fun.

First, I downloaded the package itself(it's actually a fork of i3lock).

    % packer -G i3lock-lixxia-git
    % cd i3lock-lixxia-git

Then I opened up `PKGBUILD` in vim and added a line to include my patch,
which I made with `git format-patch`:

    % diff PKGBUILD /tmp/i3lock-lixxia-git/PKGBUILD
    27d26
    <   git apply ../../dump-pw.patch

Then `makepkg -i`nstalled it and concluded that `i3lock` didn't register that I pressed enter.
Weirdâ€¦ Anyway, here's the patchfile:

    % cat dump-pw.patch
