The portfolio hosts some of my hobby projects, which hopefully hint at my technical proficiency
and the power to execute and finish projects.

<div class='sep'></div>

### [Github](https://github.com/siers) as well as [gists](https://gist.github.com/siers)
Hosts projects I work on in my free time.

### [Metronome](https://github.com/siers/mtnom) react, redux, rxjs, web audio api, 2017 sep
A an incomplete, but new metronome UI that I hadn't seen, but had conceived the idea of.
Doesn't work on mobile, requires sound. Currently hosted **[here](http://veinbahs.id.lv/)**.

### [Russian checkers](https://github.com/siers/russian-checkers/blob/master/russian-checkers.js.coffee) coffeescript, 2012 dec
This is a the logic unit that checked whether a particular move in a checkers
game is valid. (I don't have it hosted running everywhere, unfortunately.)

### [`#developerslv` IRC bot](https://github.com/siers/zn) haskell, stack, irc-client, 2016 mar
An IRC bot that listens to messages, parses them and responds to them
to amuse the users of a chatroom.

### [Heat equation solver](https://github.com/siers/parabolic-pde#pretty-pictures) haskell, repa, imagemagick, 2014 dec
Simulates the heat dissipation of a 2d plate in time.
Main reason for creation was the generation of cool [gifs](https://github.com/siers/parabolic-pde#pretty-pictures).

### [Font random](https://github.com/siers/font-random) haskell, fc-query, 2017 jul
Generates random characters from the set of available glyphs found in fonts given as input.
The usual random text generation techniques are either overrepresenting unrenderable characters
or its output spans a very limited character set. Sample output: «ɷȣȥʔɜǜ¥ȷ¢řŲɜȸúĮǖ».

### [Sudoku solver](https://github.com/siers/sudoku-solver) haskell, 2014 nov
A functional sudoku solver that can solve even the hardest puzzles within seconds.
