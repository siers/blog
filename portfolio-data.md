The portfolio hosts some of my hobby projects, which hopefully hint at my technical proficiency
and indicate the power to execute and finish projects.

## The data oriented projects:

<div class='bunch'>

### [Heat equation solver](https://github.com/siers/parabolic-pde#pretty-pictures) haskell, repa, imagemagick, 2014 dec
Simulates the heat dissipation of a 2d plate in time.
Main reason for creation was the generation of cool [gifs](https://github.com/siers/parabolic-pde#pretty-pictures).

### [Sudoku solver](https://github.com/siers/sudoku-solver) haskell, 2014 nov
A functional sudoku solver that can solve even the hardest ones within seconds.

### [Violin pitchfork](https://github.com/siers/violin-pitchfork) haskell, fft, sox, 2015 jun
This program sounds a pitch for tuning tuning your violin
that listens and determines which string you're trying to play and
responds with the correct pitch. Feedback loops remain undetected.

### [Font random](https://github.com/siers/font-random) haskell, fc-query, 2017 jul
Generates random characters from the set of available glyphs found in fonts given as input.
The usual random text generation techniques are either overrepresenting unrenderable characters
or its output spans a very limited character set.

## The more technical projects:

<div class='bunch'>

### [`#developerslv` IRC bot](https://github.com/siers/zn) haskell, stack, irc-client, 2016 mar
An IRC bot that listens to messages, parses them and responds to them
to amuse the users of a chatroom.

### [ELF executable crypter POC](https://github.com/siers/stoical) linux, c, 2012 dec
Making a PE crypter was an old goal of mine, but having become a linux user,
PEs were no longer interesting. The code doesn't use libraries thus is a little messy,
but it works most of time.

#### [My github](https://github.com/siers) & [gists](https://gist.github.com/siers) Little utilities, and other mentionable effort.
