¶ Hey there.
If you actually look at this, and I'm sure very few people have
I wouldn't mind an email or a message,
just to know it was worthwhile keeping this presentable. :)

¶ About
This blog was once written in ruby, jekyll and I really disliked jekyll since the day I saw it.
I just didn't know of anything better until I discovered hakyll.

¶ Compiling
It should be something like:

    cabal build
    cabal exec ghc site
    ./site build

¶ Logs
I wrote a bunch of scripts for analyzing lighty logs,
so check those out! Sample logs(anonymized) are provided.

    cd logs
    ./gen
    vim -p reports/{report,clean}
