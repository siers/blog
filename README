¶ About
This blog was once written in ruby, jekyll and I really disliked jekyll since the day I saw it.
I just didn't know of anything better until I discovered hakyll.
I'm sure just writing HTML would've been the best choice. (Shoutout to my homie RMS, stallman.org)

¶ Compiling
It should be something like:

    cabal build
    cabal exec ghc site
    ./site build

    or

    nix-shell -E "$(cabal2nix --shell .)" --run 'cabal build'

    or

    see default.nix
